TAT-DQA: Towards Complex Document Understanding By Discrete Reasoning
====================

**TAT-DQA** is a large-scale Document VQA dataset, which is constructed by extending the [TAT-QA](https://github.com/NExTplusplus/TAT-QA). It aims to stimulate progress of QA research over more complex and realistic visually-rich documents with rich tabular and textual content, especially those requiring numerical reasoning.


You can download our TAT-DQA dataset via [TAT-DQA Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SGpZyRWqycMd_dZim1ygvWhl5KdJYDR2).

### Updates 

**${\color{red}Jan 2024}$**: We release the ground truth for the TAT-DQA test set [TAT-DQA Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SGpZyRWqycMd_dZim1ygvWhl5KdJYDR2), to facilitate future research on this task!

**${\color{red}May 2023}$**: Source Code released! You are welcome to use the [Doc2SoarGraph repo](https://github.com/fengbinzhu/Doc2SoarGraph) to explore the TAT-DQA dataset and start your research!
